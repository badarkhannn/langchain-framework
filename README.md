# LangChain Framework Learning Repository

Welcome to the **LangChain Framework Learning Repository** — a comprehensive and structured set of resources aimed at helping developers, researchers, and enthusiasts understand and work with the powerful LangChain framework. This repository combines practical Jupyter notebooks, code demonstrations, markdown-based theoretical notes, and real-world mini-projects to ensure well-rounded learning.

LangChain enables seamless orchestration of language models with tools, documents, APIs, memory, and more. Here, we explore its core concepts along with applicable, hands-on use cases.

## Core Learning Modules

The repository is divided into logical folders that cover various foundational and advanced components of LangChain:

- **LLMs**: Basics of using language models.
- **ChatModels**: Interfacing with open and closed chat models.
- **EmbeddedModels**: Generating embeddings for similarity searches and document understanding.
- **StructuredOutput & OutputParsers**: Converting language model outputs into structured formats.
- **Chains & Runnables**: Creating sequential and composable workflows.
- **Document Loaders, Text Splitters, and VectorStores**: For chunking, parsing, storing, and retrieving documents.
- **Tools, Agents, and Retrievers**: Advanced tools and agent-based interactions.

Each section is presented as a notebook (`.ipynb`) with executable code and explanations.

## Contribution & Usage

This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes. Contributions are welcome to expand its scope with additional examples, notes, or tools.

To get started:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (file not included by default)
3. Run the notebooks in your preferred environment
