### Tool

A tool is just a python function (or API) that is packaged in a way the LLM can understand.

* Buil in tools
* Custom tools (using @tool decrorator, using strucured tool class in pydantic, using base tool class )

An Ai anets is an LLM powered system that can automously think, decide and take actions using xternal tools or api to achieve a goal.

### Tool Binding

Tool Binding is the sttep where you regsiter tools with a languae model(LLM) so that:

* The LLM know what tool are avaible
* it know what each tool does
* it knows what input format to use

### Tool calling

Toling calling is a process where the llms decide a conversion or task taht it need to use a specfic tool, and generate a structured output with

* the name of the tool
* and the argument to call it with

### Tool Execution

Tool exeution is the step where the actual python function(tool) is run using input argument that llms us during tool calling.

### AI Agents

An AI agent is an intelligent system that receives a high-level goal from a user, and autonomously plans, decides, and executes a sequence of actions by using external tools, APIs, or knowledge sources â€” all while maintaining context, reasoning over multiple steps, adapting to new information, and optimizing for the intended outcome.

* Goal-Driven
* Autonomus planning
* Tool using
* context aware
* Adaptive

### ReAct

ReAct is a design pattern used in AI agents that stands for Reasoning + Acting. It allows a language model (LLM) to interleave internal reasoning (Thought) with external actions (like tool use) in a structured, multi-step process.
